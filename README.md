Note: Decided to use a Uniswap price feed instead of Coingecko because I wanted to see how it would compare. Though the gas cost in USD is slightly off (since the ratio of ETH/USD in uni V2 swaps is not exactly equal to the price of ETH) it comes pretty close. 

### TO-DO
1) Add testing
2) Add USD gas cost with Coingecko API to compare with the Uniswap prices.
3) Add more endpoints.
